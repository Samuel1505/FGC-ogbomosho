                Welcome to Federal Government College, Ogbomoso, where we groom young Nigerians for the attainment of
                excellence in
                academic and character. The College is one of the 104 Federal Unity Colleges (FUCs) established by the

                aim of Government
                in establishing the 104 Unity Colleges is to foster national unity among youths from various parts of
                the country, hence
                the Motto: PRO UNITATE. Our core values - HARDWORK, INTERGRITY, and EXCELLENCE are the driving forces
                behind the huge
                success being recorded by this great citadel of learning. The College has a diversified and operational
                curriculum
                geared towards meeting the needs and aspirations of every learner. This is driven by the various heads
                of department in
                addition to the Guidance Counselingwhich provides counselling support to all students. This has paid off
                for the College
                as our products can be found all over the globe, excelling, competing and contributing to the
                development of this great
                nation and even beyond. Such great feats are only achieved where commitment is the watchword. Federal
                Government
                College, Ogbomoso has enjoyed the services of fourteen (14) substantive Principals since inception. The
                fifteenth (15)
                substantive and current Principal of the College is Mr. AJAGBE A.J. His tenure as the Principal of the
                College is with
